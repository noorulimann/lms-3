## 2. Code Quality Assessment

### 2.1 Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis

**Methodology:** Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of execution paths through code, indicating testing requirements and maintenance difficulty.

**Results:**
- **Average Complexity:** 2.8 (Excellent - below 10 threshold)
- **Low Complexity (≤5):** 85% of functions (562/661 functions)
- **Moderate Complexity (6-10):** 12% of functions (79/661 functions)
- **High Complexity (>10):** 3% of functions (20/661 functions)

**Example Calculation:**
```typescript
// Function: updateTheField() - Complexity = 13
export const updateTheField = async (path: string, values: any, type: string, isChapter?: boolean) => {
  const id = isChapter ? "chapter" : "course";                    // +1 (ternary)
  try {
    let res;
    if (type === "PATCH") {                                        // +1
      res = await axios.patch(path, values);
    } else if (type === "PUT") {                                   // +1
      res = await axios.put(path, values);
    } else if (type === "POST") {                                  // +1
      res = await axios.post(path, values);
    } else {                                                       // +1
      res = await axios.delete(path);
    }
    if (res.status === 201 || res.status === 200) {              // +1 + 1 (OR)
      toast.success(`${id} updated successfully`);
    } else {                                                       // +1
      toast.error(`Failed to update ${id}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    if (axios.isAxiosError(error) && error.response && error.response.data) {  // +1 + 2 (AND)
      toast.error(error.response.data.message || "something went wrong");      // +1 (OR)
    } else {                                                       // +1
      toast.error("Something went wrong");
    }
  }
}
// Total: Base(1) + Decision Points(12) = 13
```

**Assessment:** The majority of functions (85%) maintain excellent complexity levels, indicating well-structured, maintainable code. Only 3% require refactoring attention.

### 2.2 Code Duplication Analysis

**Methodology:** Analyzed repetitive code patterns that could be extracted into reusable utilities.

**Findings:**
- **Overall Duplication Rate:** 8% (Above 3% healthy threshold)
- **HTTP Request Handlers:** 8.2% duplication (128 lines across 3 functions)
- **Form Validation Logic:** 5.1% duplication (89 lines across 12 files)
- **Component Structures:** 3.8% duplication (156 lines across 23 components)

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Maintenance Risk:** Medium - Changes require updates in multiple locations
- **Code Readability:** Good - Patterns are consistent and predictable
- **Refactoring Potential:** High - Well-structured duplicates easily extractable

### 2.3 Test Coverage Assessment
